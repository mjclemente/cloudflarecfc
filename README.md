# cloudflarecfc
A CFML wrapper for the Cloudflare API

Quickly hacked together for a side project. This isn't meant to be comprehensive or complete. Just a starting point, if people are interested in messing around with Cloudflare's API via CFML.

This project borrows heavily from the API framework built by [jcberquist](https://github.com/jcberquist) with [stripecfc](https://github.com/jcberquist/stripecfc).
